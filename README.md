Writing chip 8 emulator for fun.

Nothing special, trying to remember some C and to play around with emulators again :^)

Just about done - all opcodes are finished although haven't done much testing. Only things left are hooking up emulated gpu and keyboard input. Doesn't seem very interesting as I've already done that so I'll come back to this sooner or later.
